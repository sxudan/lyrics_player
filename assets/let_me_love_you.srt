0
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,000
I used to believe

1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,800
We were burnin' on the edge of
somethin' beautiful

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,400
Somethin' beautiful

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,600
Sellin' a dream

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Smoke and mirrors keep us
waiting on a miracle

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,300
On a miracle

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,800
Say, go through the darkest of days

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,300
Heaven's a heartbreak away

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,000
Never let you go, never let me down

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,500
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,800
Driving the edge of a knife

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,400
Never let you go, never let me down

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,400
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,800
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,300
Let me love you

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,600
Let me love you

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,900
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,400
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,800
Let me love you

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let me love you

20
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,800
Don't fall asleep

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,600
At the wheel, we've got a
million miles ahead of us

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,100
Miles ahead of us

23
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,400
All that we need

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,200
Is a rude awakening to know
we're good enough

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,800
Know we're good enough

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,600
Say go through the darkest of days

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,000
Heaven's a heartbreak away

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,700
Never let you go, never let me down

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,300
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,600
Driving the edge of a knife

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,200
Never let you go, never let me down

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,200
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,600
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,000
Let me love you

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,400
Let me love you

36
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,700
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

37
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,200
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
