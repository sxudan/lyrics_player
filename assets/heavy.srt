1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,500
I don't like my mind right now

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,900
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary


3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,900
Wish that I could slow things down

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,700
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic


5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,800
And I drive myself crazy

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,600
Thinking everything's about me

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,200
Yeah, I drive myself crazy

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,900
'Cause I can't escape the gravity

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm holding on

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,550
Why is everything so heavy?

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,300
Holding on

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,200
So much more than I can carry

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,500
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down


14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,300
If I just let go, I'd be set free

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,200
Holding on

16
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,600
Why is everything so heavy?

17
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,700
You say that I'm paranoid

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,900
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me


19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's not like I make the choice

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,200
To let my mind stay so fucking messy

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,300
I know I'm not the center of the universe


22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,400
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same


23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,700
I know I'm not the center of the universe


24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,100
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same


25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,100
I'm holding on

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,600
Why is everything so heavy?

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,400
