00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,300
I had a dream

1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,800
We were sipping whisky neat

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,900
Highest floor, the bowery

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,800
And I was high enough

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
'Somewhere along the lines

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,300
We stopped seeing eye to eye

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,800
You were staying out all night

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And I had enough

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,100
No, I don't wanna know where
you been or where you're going

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,100
But I know I won't be home

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,400
And you'll be on your own

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,500
Who's gonna walk you through
the dark side of the morning?

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,900
Who's gonna rock you when the
sun won't let you sleep?

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,900
Who's waking up to drive you
home when you're drunk and all
alone?

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,900
Who's gonna walk you through
the dark side of the morning?

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,200
It ain't me

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,000
It ain't me

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
It ain't me

18
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,100
It ain't me

19
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,100
I had a dream

20
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,400
We were back to seventeen

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,800
Summer nights and the liberties

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,700
Never growing up

23
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll take with me the
polaroids and the memories

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,600
But you know I'm gonna leave
behind the worst of us

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,400
Who's gonna walk you through
the dark side of the morning?

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,200
Who's gonna rock you when the
sun won't let you sleep?

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,100
Who's waking up to drive you
home when you're drunk and all
alone?

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,000
Who's gonna walk you through
the dark side of the morning?

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,800
It ain't me, no no

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,600
It ain't me, no no

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,300
It ain't me, no no

32
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,300
Who's gonna walk you through
the dark side of the morning?

33
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,700
It ain't me

34
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,200
It ain't me

35
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,600
It ain't me

36
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,500
It ain't me

37
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:44,500
